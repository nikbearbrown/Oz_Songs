# Oz Songs

# Oz Songs Project README

## Overview
Over the next year, I'll be creating "Oz Songs" - a video musical adaptation of The Wizard of Oz using a blend of human voices (including my own) and AI-generated art and music. This project reimagines L. Frank Baum's classic series through contemporary musical interpretations while exploring the creative possibilities of human-AI collaboration.

## Project Goals
- Create songs for each chapter of all 14 books in the Oz series
- Produce accompanying videos with AI-generated imagery
- Document the entire creative process through daily experiments
- Share code, prompts, and techniques for others to learn from

## Current Progress
- Completed songs for the first four chapters of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" (1900)
- Developed character design prompts for key characters
- Created initial music for Chapter I: The Cyclone

## Process Documentation
I'll be documenting my creative journey through:
- Daily experiment journals
- YouTube tutorials showing my workflow
- Open-source code repositories
- Detailed breakdowns of prompts and parameters
